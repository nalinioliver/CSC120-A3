Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?

I consulted with Dakota on this assignment. 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?

I attended Jordan's Monday office hours (2/13). I also attended CSC TA hours on Monday (2/13) and Thursday (2/16). 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Overall, I feel like I can't appreciate Java on it's own, because I'm constantly comparing it to Python. This is because other students I've known have said that Python is a much more intuitive and easy to use programming language, which already made Java feel daunting to me as I entered this course. I would agree that the terminology (methods, classes, etc.) as well as needing to specify everything (public, void, etc.) is overwhelming. However, I find that talking about it during CSC TA hours did make it feel more manegable to some degree/ not as scary as I intally thought!

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Overall, I would say that programming relies upon the need to categorize things into certain "types" and then attempts to provide tools that can manipulate and use objects of a certain "type" to create something new. In python, this idea is less prominent (as there isn't always a need to specify), but in both Python and Java, we see that there are tools specific to a certain "kind" of varaible that relies on this concept. In java, it is much more prominent, where (for exapmple) it only allows arrays to be formed of specific types. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For this assignment, I felt that I did a better job of knowing how much time I needed to get specific parts done. Even though I was unable to complete the part of the assignment where we attempt to mirror the words (while I had partial code it would make my program unable to run, so I ended up omitting it) I still felt that I made a lot of progress in using Java overall. This includes understanding the differences in syntax, building a for loop, and knowing the order for executing specific functions. However, this was still a huge challenge in other respects (evident in the fact that I still need to work on completeing the "mirroring" portion of this assignment). I feel that being able to translate the information we learn from Prof. Crouser's lectures to the assignment goals have been difficult for me, and something I would like to work on further.
